# Explanation of  the 'Type' column

To facilitate programming, the nine OpenAI API categories are represented numerically during implementation. The corresponding type numbers for each of these categories are as follows:

| Type Number | OpenAI API Category   |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| 1           | Chat API              |
| 2           | Embeddings API        |
| 3           | Audio API             |
| 4           | Assistants API        |
| 5           | Fine-tuning API       |
| 6           | Image Generation  API |
| 7           | Code Generation API   |
| 8           | GPT Actions API       |
| -1          | Others                |

Note: Type 0 indicates cases that are not related to developers' usage of OpenAI APIs.
